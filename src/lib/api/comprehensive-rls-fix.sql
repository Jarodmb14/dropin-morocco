-- 5. VERIFY RLS IS ENABLED
-- ==============================================

-- Ensure RLS is enabled on all tables
ALTER TABLE bookings ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE clubs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE reviews ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- ==============================================
-- 6. TEST QUERIES
-- ==============================================

-- Test that we can read from all tables
SELECT 'bookings' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM bookings
UNION ALL
SELECT 'clubs' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM clubs
UNION ALL
SELECT 'profiles' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM profiles
UNION ALL
SELECT 'reviews' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM reviews;
